# Karyasetu 🏗️  
### AI-Powered Construction Safety & Progress Monitoring System

Karyasetu is a full-stack web-based platform designed to bring transparency, safety, and efficiency to construction site management. It bridges the gap between on-site activities and management teams by leveraging **Computer Vision**, **AI**, and a **modern web dashboard**.

---

## 🚧 Problem Statement

Construction project management faces multiple challenges:
- Unreliable and delayed site updates
- Lack of real-time visibility into site activities
- Late identification of safety issues and project delays
- Poor coordination across multiple construction sites
- Manual, error-prone daily reporting processes

Traditional paper-based and verbal reporting systems fail to provide accurate, trustworthy, and timely information for decision-making.

---

## 💡 Solution – Karyasetu

Karyasetu provides an **AI-driven monitoring system** that enables managers to:
- Visually track construction progress
- Detect safety compliance issues early
- Access transparent, image-based proof of site activities
- Generate automated daily reports
- Maintain a digital record of construction data for future planning

## ✨ Key Features

- 📸 **Photo & Location Proof**  
  Time-stamped and location-based image uploads ensure transparent and trustworthy reporting.

- 🦺 **AI-Based Safety Monitoring**  
  Computer Vision models analyze site images to detect safety compliance (e.g., helmet presence).

- 📊 **Progress Tracking Dashboard**  
  Visual indicators show construction progress stages such as foundation, structure, and finishing.

- ⏱️ **Early Issue Detection**  
  Identifies delays, safety risks, and inconsistencies before they escalate into major problems.

- 📝 **Automatic Daily Reports**  
  Reduces manual reporting effort and minimizes human errors.

- 📱 **Simple & User-Friendly Interface**  
  Designed as a lightweight web application accessible from mobile devices.

- 🗂️ **Digital Record Storage**  
  Centralized storage of historical project data for analysis and future decision-making.
